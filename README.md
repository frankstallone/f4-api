# Frank Stallone – Work‑With‑Me API  (v07‑07-2025)

## What I optimise for
Customer impact → shipping velocity → elegance → team growth

## Principles
- **Facts before ego** – I will change my mind when data or users prove me wrong
- **Default to trust** – I assume positive intent and reciprocate it
- **One team, one score** – Company wins outrank function wins
- **Kaizen every day** – Small, continuous improvements beat sporadic moon-shots
- **Law of attraction** – We get the energy we project, so let’s stay solution-oriented

## Teammates thrive when they…
1. Push back with evidence, prototypes, or user anecdotes
2. Send a five-line summary before requesting a meeting
3. Turn “learns” into proposals, not complaints
4. Own the outcome, not just the task
5. Share their growth goals so I can sponsor them

## Communication contract
| Channel | Use for | SLA |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Slack DM | Urgent blockers (<2 h) | ≥ within 2 h, work hrs |
| Slack thread | Questions, async feedback | Same day |
| Docs (PRD, spec, brief, RFC) | Proposals, specs | 24 h comment turn‑around |
| Meeting | Decision or true brainstorm | Agenda + doc 24 h prior |

_Note: Written > verbal for me, and I value time to think before we meet live._

## Conflict resolution

- **Listen first, always** - I'll always start by genuinely understanding your viewpoint, asking questions before I respond.
- **Bring data, stay clear** - Facts, user insights, and measurable results resonate strongly with me. I'll reciprocate, and together we'll evaluate objectively.
- **Raise concerns early** - Ping me via Slack or add a quick note as soon as you sense friction—early signals keep issues manageable.
- **Neutral, solution-focused language** - Frame discussions calmly: “Here's what I'm seeing..., here's my concern..., what's the best way to solve this together?” This ensures we stay collaborative and clear.
- **Space for thoughtful reflection** - If a conversation gets heated, expect me to pause briefly to process and gather my thoughts before we reconnect constructively.
- **Escalation rhythm: Flag → Collaborate → Decide** - Surface friction quickly, explore the data openly, then seek a mutual solution first. If we’re still stuck after a day, I'll pick a transparent, low-risk path, document my reasoning, and schedule a follow-up checkpoint. Fresh insights always reopen the door—ego stays sidelined.
- **Relationship first** - Even in disagreement, we remain teammates. Let's explicitly remind each other of that.
- **Close the loop** - After resolving the issue, a quick follow-up ensures solutions hold and trust grows stronger.

## 1‑on‑1s / feedback
- Weekly 30 min, agenda owned by **you**. Template: Wins, Challenges, Growth, Topics
- I give real‑time praise; constructive feedback in writing first, then live discussion
- Expect lightweight career check-ins every quarter

## Autonomy & decision rights
- **You decide:** rollout plans ≤ medium size, A/B variants, team rituals, your product domain expertise
- **Consult me:** cross‑team dependencies, clarifying thinking, roadmap re‑prioritisation

## Quirks
- Early bird: Deep-work 9 – 10 a.m. ET — please avoid meetings then
- My default greeting is “howdy”
- I read faster than I listen, so crisp writing wins
- Vague arguments trigger my Spidey-sense; bring structure and data
- I’m a hopeless optimist: expect “we’ve got this!” energy

## My Promise to You
- Remove blockers within 24 h
- Sponsor you for stretch projects when you show readiness
- Celebrate your wins publicly, coach privately
- Protect thinking time and psychological safety
