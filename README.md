# Frank Stallone – Work‑With‑Me API  (v07‑07-2025)

## What I optimise for
Customer impact → shipping velocity → elegance → team growth

## Principles
- **Facts before ego** – I will change my mind when data or users prove me wrong
- **Default to trust** – I assume positive intent and reciprocate it
- **One team, one score** – Company wins outrank function wins
- **Kaizen every day** – Small, continuous improvements beat sporadic moon-shots
- **Law of attraction** – We get the energy we project, so let’s stay solution-oriented

## Teammates thrive when they…
1. Push back with evidence, prototypes, or user anecdotes
2. Send a five-line summary before requesting a meeting
3. Turn “learns” into proposals, not complaints
4. Own the outcome, not just the task
5. Share their growth goals so I can sponsor them

## Communication contract
| Channel | Use for | SLA |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Slack DM | Urgent blockers (<2 h) | ≥ within 2 h, work hrs |
| Slack thread | Questions, async feedback | Same day |
| Docs (PRD, spec, brief, RFC) | Proposals, specs | 24 h comment turn‑around |
| Meeting | Decision or true brainstorm | Agenda + doc 24 h prior |

_Note: Written > verbal for me, and I value time to think before we meet live._

## Conflict resolution

- **Lead with curiosity and active listening** - I start every tense discussion by asking questions to surface everyone’s data and perspectives before reacting
- **Bring evidence, not volume** - Facts, user anecdotes, and metrics move me far more than passionate assertions; I’ll reciprocate with my own data so we can evaluate side-by-side
- **Surface concerns early** - A quick Slack message or “heads-up” comment prevents tension from stockpiling and avoids a surprising escalation later on
- **Use a short, neutral script** - Try: _“What I’m seeing is __. My concern is __. I’d like to solve __ together.”_—it keeps the conversation calm and solution-focused
- **Give me reflection space if the call gets heated** - When harmony fails, I shift into an analytical mode and may go quiet to gather facts before we reconvene
- **Escalation rhythm – flag → collaborate → decide** - Surface the friction early; we'll hunt for compromise first. If still blocked after one business day, I'll choose the least‑regret path, document rationale, and set a checkpoint so new evidence can reopen the decision.
- **Depersonalize and affirm the relationship** - A calm tone and reminders that we’re on the same side help me stay in the collaborative zone
- **Close the loop afterward** - Once we land a solution, I like a quick follow-up to restore trust and ensure we’re stronger than before.

## 1‑on‑1s / feedback
- Weekly 30 min, agenda owned by **you**. Template: Wins, Challenges, Growth, Topics
- I give real‑time praise; constructive feedback in writing first, then live discussion
- Expect lightweight career check-ins every quarter

## Autonomy & decision rights
- **You decide:** rollout plans ≤ medium size, A/B variants, team rituals, your product domain expertise
- **Consult me:** cross‑team dependencies, clarifying thinking, roadmap re‑prioritisation

## Quirks
- Early bird: Deep-work 9 – 10 a.m. ET — please avoid meetings then
- My default greeting is “howdy”
- I read faster than I listen, so crisp writing wins
- Vague arguments trigger my Spidey-sense; bring structure and data
- I’m a hopeless optimist: expect “we’ve got this!” energy

## My Promise to You
- Remove blockers within 24 h
- Sponsor you for stretch projects when you show readiness
- Celebrate your wins publicly, coach privately
- Protect thinking time and psychological safety
