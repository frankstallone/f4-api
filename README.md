# F4 API
## Frank Stallone – Work‑With‑Me API
_v01‑31‑2026 (rev: SDI-informed)_

## What I optimise for
Customer impact → shipping velocity → elegance → team growth

## Principles
- **Facts before ego** – I will change my mind when data or users prove me wrong
- **Default to trust** – I assume positive intent and reciprocate it
- **One team, one score** – Company wins outrank function wins
- **Kaizen every day** – Small, continuous improvements beat sporadic moon-shots
- **Law of attraction** – We get the energy we project, so let’s stay solution-oriented

## Teammates thrive when they…
1. Push back with evidence, prototypes, or user anecdotes
2. Send a quick summary before requesting a meeting
3. Turn “learns” into proposals, not complaints
4. Own the outcome, not just the task
5. Share their growth goals so I can sponsor them

## Communication preferences

- **Slack DM > email** - fastest way to grab my attention for urgent matters
- **Threads for async debate** - keep context in one spot; mention me if you need a same-day response
- **Docs or Figma for deep dives** - tag me; I'll respond within 24 h
- **Loom for walk-throughs > 5 min** - visuals help me absorb quickly; I'll leave timestamped comments
- **Agenda + pre-read 24h before meetings** - gives everyone space to prepare and contribute thoughtfully
- **Meeting padding** – End meetings 5–10 minutes early (25 min instead of 30, 50 min instead of 60). This breathing room helps everyone regroup, wrap notes, and transition comfortably to what's next.
- **Camera on when possible** - face-to-face energy beats anonymous squares
- **Bullet points > paragraphs for recaps** - clarify and scannability win every time
- **PRD, spec, brief, RFC for big objectives** - clarifing thinking with writing shows you've thought through pros, cons, and risks

_Note: Written > verbal for me, and I value time to think before we meet live._

## Decision making process
- **Listen first, always** - I'll always start by genuinely understanding your viewpoint, asking questions before I respond.
- **Bring data, stay clear** - Facts, user insights, and measurable results resonate strongly with me. I'll reciprocate, and together we'll evaluate objectively.
- **Raise concerns early** - Ping me via Slack or add a quick note as soon as you sense friction—early signals keep issues manageable.
- **Neutral, solution-focused language** - Frame discussions calmly: “Here's what I'm seeing..., here's my concern..., what's the best way to solve this together?” This ensures we stay collaborative and clear.
- **Space for thoughtful reflection** - If a conversation gets heated, expect me to pause briefly to process and gather my thoughts before we reconnect constructively.
- **Escalation rhythm: Flag → Collaborate → Decide** - Surface friction quickly, explore the data openly, then seek a mutual solution first. If we’re still stuck after a day, I'll pick a transparent, low-risk path, document my reasoning, and schedule a follow-up checkpoint. Fresh insights always reopen the door—ego stays sidelined.
- **Relationship first** - Even in disagreement, we remain teammates. Let's explicitly remind each other of that.
- **Close the loop** - After resolving the issue, a quick follow-up ensures solutions hold and trust grows stronger.

### Conflict style (under stress)
My SDI conflict sequence tends to look like **Blue → Green → Red**:
- **Blue (harmony-first):** I’ll listen, accommodate, and try to keep things collaborative.
- **Green (analysis):** if it’s still messy, I may go quieter while I gather facts and think.
- **Red (decisive):** if it drags on, I’ll push for a clear decision and may come in stronger than you expect.

**How to work with this (the cheat code):**
- If you notice me getting quiet, don’t assume disengagement — ask: “Do you want time to think, or do you want to talk it through now?”
- Help me “bridge” the Green phase with a quick check-in line: “I’m not fully landed yet, but here’s what I’m concerned about…”
- If I’m coming in hot, it’s usually because I let friction simmer too long. It’s totally fair to say: “Let’s slow down and restate the shared goal.”

## 1‑on‑1s / feedback
- Weekly 30 min, agenda owned by **you**. Template: Wins, Challenges, Growth, Topics
- I give real‑time praise; constructive feedback in writing first, then live discussion
- Expect lightweight career check-ins every quarter

### How to give me feedback (so it lands)
- **Start with the goal:** “Here’s what we’re optimizing for…”
- **Name the observation (facts):** “I observed X…”
- **Name the impact:** “The impact was Y…”
- **Make a request:** “Can we try Z next time?”

If it’s sensitive: send it in writing first. I’ll process better and show up calmer.

## Quirks
- Early bird: Deep-work 9 – 10 a.m. ET — please avoid meetings then
- My default greeting is “howdy”
- I read faster than I listen, so crisp writing wins
- Vague arguments trigger my Spidey-sense; bring structure and data
- If it takes me less ≤ 15 minutes I will execute, > 15 minutes I will get it in queue
- I'm insatiably curious
- I always assume positive intent
- I’m a hopeless optimist: expect “we’ve got this!” energy

### My overdone-strengths (help me avoid these)
- **Over-supporting / overcommitting:** If you see me saying “yes” too quickly, ask: “What are you saying no to if you take this?”
- **Modesty / under-selling impact:** If I ship something meaningful, it helps if you reflect it back: “That moved X metric / unblocked Y.”
- **Too much harmony:** If something’s off, I’d rather hear it early than get surprised later.

## My Promise to You
- Remove blockers within 24 h
- Sponsor you for stretch projects when you show readiness
- Celebrate your wins publicly, coach privately
- Protect thinking time and psychological safety
